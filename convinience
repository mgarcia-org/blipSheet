# blipSheet
blipSheet is a spreadsheet (CVS) interface for bliplay:https://github.com/detomon/bliplay


All files are saved in blipSheet.xls (expect pika.wav), but provided here for convenience.
Works in Linux Mint 18.1 64bit, not tested in any other operating system!
Use at own risk, etc



I like using the spreadsheet, I like the logic of columns and tracks and also like having the different sheets open, ie commands.
